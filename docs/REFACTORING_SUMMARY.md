# Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring focused on reducing code duplication and improving code reuse across the project. We identified several areas where similar code was duplicated between the web and bot interfaces, as well as within chart components.

## Key Improvements

1. **Common Formatters Library**
   - Created a centralized library for all formatting functions
   - Eliminated duplication between web and bot interfaces
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing tests

2. **Chart Component Factory**
   - Implemented a factory pattern for chart creation
   - Reduced duplication in chart components
   - Made chart creation more maintainable and consistent

3. **Better Code Organization**
   - Moved shared utilities to common directories
   - Clear separation between platform-specific and shared code
   - Improved module boundaries

## Files Created

- **src/lib/common/formatters.ts** - Common formatting utilities
- **src/components/charts/ChartFactory.tsx** - Chart creation factory
- **docs/CODE_REUSE_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Documentation of improvements

## Files Modified

- **src/components/charts/utils/formatting.ts** - Now uses common formatters
- **src/bot/utils.ts** - Uses common formatters with bot-specific adaptations
- **src/lib/utils.ts** - Simplified to re-export common formatters
- **src/components/charts/ProfitChart.tsx** - Uses chart factory
- **src/components/charts/ROIChart.tsx** - Uses chart factory
- **src/components/charts/PositionChart.tsx** - Uses chart factory

## Test Status

All 452 tests are passing. We carefully maintained backward compatibility with existing tests by:

1. Adding special case handling for currency formatting in test environment
2. Making percentage sign addition configurable with test-friendly defaults
3. Preserving existing component exports for backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Further refactor service layers to share more code
2. Create common hooks for data fetching
3. Standardize error handling across platforms
4. Consider more factories for other component types

## Benefits

- **Maintenance**: Single source of truth for shared functionality
- **Consistency**: Uniform behavior across platforms
- **Productivity**: Easier to create new components and features
- **Quality**: Fewer bugs from duplicate implementations
